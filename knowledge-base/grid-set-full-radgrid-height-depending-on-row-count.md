## Description

When scrolling is enabled, the scroll area of the grid has a fixed scroll height of 300px. This causes a blank space to appear if theÂ item  count is too low.

## Solution
  
If you want the grid to have its height automatically adjusted to its records, you can set an empty value to the following property:  

````
<Scrolling ScrollHeight="" />
````

You can also set this property programmaticaly to `Unit.Empty`:

````C#
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (!IsPostBack)
    {
        RadGrid1.ClientSettings.Scrolling.ScrollHeight = Unit.Empty;
    }
}
````
````VB
Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Handles Me.Load
    If Not IsPostBack Then
        RadGrid1.ClientSettings.Scrolling.ScrollHeight = Unit.Empty
    End If
End Sub
````
